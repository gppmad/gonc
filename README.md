# Go NetCat Implementation

A Go implementation of the NetCat (`nc`) utility, focusing on networking functionality with zero dependencies and an idiomatic Go approach.


## Current Features

- TCP client

## Installation

Since this project is not yet published as a Go package, you can install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:gppmad/gonc.git
cd gonc
```

```bash
# Build the project
go build -o nc
```

## Usage Examples

# Connect to a remote TCP server

The actual implementation is using the https://tcpbin.com/ server.
So if you just run it you will get as a response the thing that you've just submitted.


```bash
./gonc 
```
